# Video UltraWidify
Video UltraWidify is a smart cross-browser extension that adjusts the video aspact ratio to match that of UltraWide monitors.
<br />
<br />
#### Video UltraWidify seeks to fix the following issue:
Many online video service providers such as Disney+ and Netflix add black borders to top and buttom of their videos in order to make them more cinematic (21:9 Aspect ratio). This cuases the videos to show up with borers on all 4 sides on Ultrawide monitors, resulting in an unpleasent viewing experience.


## Features:
★ Works on all video streaming platforms and other embedded videos.
<br />★ Ability to pause the extension.
<br />★ Ability to toggle between Normal, Stretched or Upscaled viewing mode.
<br />★ Configurable keyboard shortcuts.
